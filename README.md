# Openai_To_IBM_Watson
In this project I am trying to convert the Response from openAI gpt 3.5 turbo API to speech using the IBM api. The response is being converted as it is sent, with a condition of 2 full stops so that the voice does not sound broken, and tokens are not full words so this condition deals with that too.
